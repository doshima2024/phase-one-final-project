For this project, I've built a single page application using an index.html file, index.jss file for JavaScript, style.css file for CSS styling and a db.json file that is custom created.

The app allows users to click a button and receive a list of suggested artists, populated using fetch() and a forEach method on the db.json data.
It also allows users to use a form submission to populate an <ol> element with songs for their own custom playlist. It also uses

My three event listeners are: 
1. a click event on the button element
2. a submit event on the user form element
3. a mouseover event that changes the color of the <h1> element
4. a mouseout event that changes the color of the <h1> element back to the original color
